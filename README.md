# Glad Loader Cmake Project

A Cmake project that allows for a quick setup of the Glad loader. This version loads OpenGL 4.6.

## Purpose

I have created this project for easy setup of the Glad loader with Cmake many times, so I figured I should just make it a git repo.

When Cmake is run with `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` set to `Debug`, the debug version of Glad is used.
Else, the release version is used.

## Note

I am not the creator of the Glad loader and am not affiliated with the project. I just enjoy using the library. :)

I used a generator by David Herberth to generate the versions of Glad included in this repository.
This generator is found [here](https://glad.dav1d.de/).
